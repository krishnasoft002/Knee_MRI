# Knee MRI Images
This projects includes both back-end (Keras, Flask with dependencies) and front-end/deployement (HTML, CSS, JS) parts. The project perform X-rays of human lungs classification using Convolutional Neural Networks with automated image pre-processing and internal procedures. Saved files of inspected models are saved on specific folders in project directory.

The accuracy of the model is approximately 80% (with the help of some regularization techniques as Dropout, L2 Regularization and Rmsprop with Adam).
